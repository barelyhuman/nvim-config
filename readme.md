# neovim config

I don't use neovim much but I do have a config in case I really need to switch to it when the
other alternatives start hanging up.

This isn't a new config but just a modular version of the [single file config gist](https://gist.github.com/barelyhuman/af6c791ad950980314f2d9b29b521b91)

## Usage

Just clone this repo to your `.config/nvim` folder (or the respective folder in windows)

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/barelyhuman/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

Open `nvim`

```sh
nvim
```

Let it do it's job
